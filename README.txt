Olivia is a multipurpose moderation bot for Discord

Scheduling Messages:
    Olivia is able to schedule messages to be send after a certain
    amount of time passes. It uses a 2D array, storing each message
    in its own row, with each row containing information about the
    message (User, Channel, Time Left, Message).
